								VALIDATIONS

VALID? AND INVALID?

**Before saving an Active Record object, Rails runs your validations. If these validations produce any errors, Rails does not save the object.

class Property < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end

 property = Property.create(ptype: "residential")
 property.valid?
 => false  (because we didnt provide name)

 property.invalid?
 => true    (because we didnt provide name)

 

 property.errors.size    
 => 1      (After Active Record has performed validations, any errors found can be accessed through the errors instance method, which returns a        collection of errors)


 property.errors.objects.first.full_message      (error message)
 => "Name can't be blank"
