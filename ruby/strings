**Strings-A String object in Ruby holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of one or more bytes, typically representing characters that represent human language.

**If you need to place an apostrophe within a single-quoted string literal, precede it with a backslash, so that the Ruby interpreter does not think that it terminates the string −

puts 'this is mohit\'s book'

Output-
this is mohit's book

--------------------------------------------------

**String Methods-
**sub and sub!

*sub -substitute the string temporarily and only first string if two same are available if we again use that string than it will be in its original form

name= "mohit"
puts name.sub("it",'ini')
puts name
Output-
mohini
mohit

*sub! -substitute the string permanently


name= "mohit"
puts name.sub!("it",'ini')
puts name

**gsub-Gsub is closest to a “replace string” method

value='hello'
puts value
puts value.sub('l','*')
puts value.gsub('l','*')

Output-
hello
he*lo
he**o
