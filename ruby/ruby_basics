Class and Objects

A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. The object is also called as an instance of a class. For Example, the animal is a class and mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are the instances of the class
Syntax-
class Class_name

end

Object-object_name = Class_name.new


In Ruby member functions are called as methods. Every method is defined by the def keyword followed by a method name. The name of the method is always in lowercase and the method ends with end keyword. In Ruby, each class and methods end with end keyword.
